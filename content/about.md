Hi, I'm Freddy Rangel. I'm a software engineer and author of "React Under the
Hood: A Beginner's Guide". I teach workshops and occasionally go on the
conference circuit. I have over a decade of real-world professional experience
working on everything from back-end microservices to front-end SPAs. I've mostly
worked with Rust, Ruby, TypeScript, and Go and everything in-between.

Feel free to reach out on my socials or [email me](mailto:frederick.rangel@gmail.com).
