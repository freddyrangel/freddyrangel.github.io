Hi, I'm Freddy Rangel. I'm a software engineer and author of "React Under the
Hood: A Beginner's Guide". I teach workshops and occasionally go on the
conference circuit. I have over a decade of real-world professional experience
working on everything from back-end microservices to front-end SPAs. I've mostly
worked with Rust, Ruby, TypeScript, and Go and everything in-between.

Before entering tech, I received a BA in Economics from the University of
California, Berkeley. Afterward I served in the US Army as a Combat Engineer
Officer. I lead a Route Clearance Team (RCT) tasked with detecting,
investigating, and neutralizing explosives in Afghanistan.

Feel free to reach out on my socials or [email me](mailto:frederick.rangel@gmail.com).
