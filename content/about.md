Hi, I'm Freddy Rangel, a software engineer, author, and public speaker. I build
things with computers then tell people about it. My philosophy on tools,
languages, frameworks, and platforms is straightforward: if it fits, it ships.
My true passion lies in the methodologies, processes, and principles of software
development. The goal of our field is to deliver working, high-quality software
that meets real-world needs efficiently and affordably. I champion any approach
that furthers this goal.

Over the years, I've authored books and maintained an occasional blog where I
explore various facets of software development. Every now and then, I embark on
conference tours and conduct workshops, like an old man yelling at a cloud.
